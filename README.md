What is JoustMania????
--------------------------------------

* JoustMania is a collection of PlayStation Move enabled party games based off of the "Jostling" mechanic introduced in [Johann Sebastian Joust](http://www.jsjoust.com/)
* JoustMania includes FFA, Teams, Werewolves, Zombies, Commander modes, and lots of other goodies!
* The system is also designed to be easy to set up at conventions and is made to run itself with a large group of people. In convention mode, every game is started once everyone is ready, and announces the rules aloud for new players to learn.

Cool Stuffs!
--------------------------------------

* 16+ Player support
* Super easy setup
* Runs in Headless mode, no screen required
* Optional web interface, view status and change game settings with your phone
* Custom music support, play with your own music
* Convention mode, no manual instructions needed, the game plays itself and switches between game modes

Hardware
---------------------------
You will need the following to run JoustMania:

* A Raspberry Pi 3 B with sd card

Optional and **highly recommended**:

* Class 1, Bluetooth 4.0 USB adapters (http://a.co/8YKP9tG)

Note on Hardware: The internal bluetooth is short range and has a high latency, making gameplay laggy and slow, although still possible.
The class 1 adapters allow bluetooth connections up to 300+ feet and allow for the gameplay to be smooth, each adapter can connect to 6 to 7 controllers. I've tested this build with three adapters and 16 controllers successfully.

Optional:

* USB hub for charging controllers (http://a.co/7T3HDmJ)

This will allow you to charge 9 controllers at once through the pi

For questions on hardware, or if you would like to inquire about purchasing a fully setup Joustmania device, please reach out to joustmaniagame@gmail.com

Installation
---------------------------

0. [Download](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/) and [Install](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/README.md) Raspbian on the micro SD card, this build was tested on the full version of raspian stretch.
0. Connect the bluetooth adapters and speaker
0. Turn on the pi, open a Terminal and run these commands, the pi will reboot on a successful install
```
git clone https://github.com/adangert/JoustMania.git
cd JoustMania
sudo ./setup.sh
```
If you have the bluetooth adapters, disable the on-board bluetooth
```
sudo ./disable_internal_bluetooth.sh
```
You can now disconnect the hdmi cable and run JoustMania in headless mode. JoustMania will automatically boot up on restart.

Update Joust Mania
---------------------------
You can update Joust Mania by doing a `git pull` in the main directory and running
```
./setup.sh
```


Pairing controllers
---------------------------

* In order to pair controllers permanently, plug them into the Raspberry Pi via USB
* Once plugged in, the controller should turn white indicating that it has been paired correctly
* Press the PlayStation sync button (the circular one in the middle) to wirelessly connect paired controllers to the Pi

If pairing is not working for some reason, or you would like to resync all controllers run the following
```
cd ~/JoustMania/
python clear-devices.py
```

How to select a game mode
---------------------------------
* In order to change between games, on any controller press the select button (located on the left side of a controller)
* Changing game types will turn you into an Admin
* Press start (located on the right side) on any controller to launch the selected game
* In order to remove a controller from play press all four front buttons

Admin Mode (Sensitivity and convention mode settings)
---------------------------------
You can become an Admin by changing the game mode via the select button, this will allow you to modify the games settings from the four front buttons on the controller, After a game is played the Admin mode will be reset

* (Cross) Add or remove a game from Convention mode, your controller will be green if the game is added and Red if it is not, Custom Teams mode can not be added to the Convention mode
* (Circle) Change sensitivity of the game. There are three settings, slow, medium, and fast, you will hear a corresponding sound for each
* (Square) toggle the playback of instructions for each game
* (Triangle) show battery level on all controllers

Web Interface
---------------------------------
Joustmania can also be controlled via a web browser on your laptop or smartphone. If your Pi is on a network, use the IP address of your Pi (for example, http://192.168.1.xxx/). Alternatively, you can turn your Pi in to an access point and connect your device directly to it. To enable this,  run the command
```
sudo ./enable_ap.sh
```
Note that this disables normal Wi-Fi on the Pi, but a wired connection will still work. The default SSID is "JOUSTMANIA" and the default password is "joustmania"; both (and other) settings may be adjusted in the apfiles/hostapd.conf file before running enable_ap.sh. To connect to the game, go to http://joust.mania in your web browser. To disable the access point and restore Wi-Fi, run the command
```
sudo ./disable_ap.sh
```

Custom Music
---------------------------------
* JoustMania comes with a couple of pre-installed default songs.
* Play your own music, by copying it into the respective folders: /audio/(Joust, Zombie, Commander)/music/
* Supports Mp3, Wav, Ogg, flac and others [Here](http://www.ffmpeg.org/general.html#File-Formats),
* All music and audio can be disabled by changing `audio = False` in joustconfig.ini, this will also disable tempo sensitivity changes for each game mode
